:   **Professional Incident Response** \
    You built it; they broke it; now what? In this talk learn how to advance your incident 
    response plan beyond a policy document and into a scalable framework that enables your 
    team to respond, track, and report on incidents of every size by leveraging what professional 
    responders do every single day.

    * Presented at HouSecCon 5.0
    * https://brooksgarrett.com/talk/professional-incident-response/

:   **Dynamically controllable dynamic scanning** \
    Security teams also wrestle with dynamic scanning. Demand is not always consistent, but 
    hardware is expensive to purchase and maintain–only to sit idle. What if there were a way 
    to automate dynamic scanning after each build in a continuous build environment while not 
    leaving servers idle during periods of inactivity?
